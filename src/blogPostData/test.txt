I agree with your point that the C-ARIES algorithm improves recovery by introducing multi-threading which ARIES lacks. By allowing multiple threads to work on different tasks simultaneously C-ARIES reduces the time it takes to complete recovery which leads to faster database availability. The page-by-page approach you mentioned really does enhance concurrency because it lets Redo and Undo tasks occur independently on different parts of the database. This is especially important in systems where large datasets need to be recovered quickly. While the new structures introduced in C-ARIES like SCRs and modified CLRs add complexity the performance improvements make them worthwhile. It is true that managing multiple threads increases the systemâ€™s complexity and potential for bugs but the speed and scalability gained from multi-threading are huge advantages for modern databases that often deal with concurrent transactions. I think the complexity is justified by the fact that C-ARIES not only improves recovery speed but also handles failures and rollbacks better than ARIES. The added scalability and ability to process tasks in parallel make C-ARIES more suitable for systems that demand high availability especially in environments where downtime needs to be minimized during recovery.
